Hello there thank you for checking out my capstone project. As you go through
the project you'll see various things which affect the way the tests are supposed to work
this is a guide for understanding possible issues you may run into. 
The registration tests require a close paying attention to because they have CAPTCHA that pops up and must be filled.
Verifying the new register also won't work unless you make sure to enter unique credentials.
I also noticed why doing my login tests that the users I've previously created have been deleted so you will have to use a
fresh account.
